            <h2>Signal Generator - in progress</h2>
            <p>In order to better learn electronics, my colegue, Cârnaț Darian, and I are building 
                a signal generator which will allow us to test the learned circuits at home.
                This way, we will no longer be forced to wait a week until the next electronics 
                lab at school.</p>
