                At chess competitions, the two players use aspecial timer to measure the time left. This special timer actualy 
                has 2 timers inside. When a player has made his move, he presses a button, his timer 
                freezes and the opponets timer starts counting down.<br>
                The need for 2 separate timers and the fast switching between them renders the simple preinstalled 
                phone timers useless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, there are apps with chess timers. "But", my friend Simon tought, "wouldn't an arduino clock be nicer?"
                I agreed and we started building the so called "Chess Clock".

                The end goal of the project is a timer for chess competitons. It does:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide chess timer functionality</li>
                <li>Provide simple timer functionality</li>
                <li>Function as a digital dice (with 1 or 2 dice)</li>
                <li>Run on batteries</li>
                <li>Have an LCD display</li>
                <li>Have LED and audio alerts</li>
            </ul>

                Actualy soldering the cables for this project was harder than designing the circuit, mainly because we used an arduino 
                Uno and we had to solder header pins to every wire.<br>
                By using a board for soldering the rest of the electronic components we made our job much, much easier.

                I designed the chassis in a 3d modeling program called "Blender" and printed it on an "Ender 3 Pro" with the 
                help of "Cura" slicer. The chassis is made of two main parts held together by M3 screws.<br>
                The front holds the LCD and the buttons while the back holds the batteries.

                The code for the arduino was written both by Simon and myself, however Simon had more contributions.<br>
                The 1500 lines are divided into 8 different files, have been worked one with 
                the help of version control system "git" and are stored on a "github". The repository is however 
                not public Some of my lines are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The code for detecting button presses</li>
                    <li>The code for showing deciseconds</li>
                    <li>The code for the dice mode</li>
