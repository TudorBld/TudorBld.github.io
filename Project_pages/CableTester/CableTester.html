                A factory from Cluj, called "Renolith", was in need of a cable tester for a cable with many wires inside.<br>
                Due to good relations with the "Applied Informatics" university teacher at UTCN, they opted to fund the 
                building of such a device, so that one student can glimpse at the world of electronics engeneering.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it turnes out, that student was I. It was a great oportunity to learn, so I did not turn it down.
            </p>
            <p>
                The end goal of the project is a Cable tester for multiple wire cables. It does:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Check for typical and less typical wire errors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mismach type errors</li>
                    <li>Open circuit type errors</li>
                    <li>Multiple outputs type errors</li>
                    <li>Short circuit type errors</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Provide an easy to read interface for operators</li>
            </ul>

                The problems encountered in the area of electronics are the high number of wires, and such the 
                high numbers of components used, and the uncertainty of how many led need to be powered by an arduino pin. 
                Due to the high number wires, using a controll circuit for each one of them was out of the question)<br>
                The interface consists of a LED for each wire, a master OK LED, a master ERROR LED and 2 buttons (reset, next).
                The wire LED-s light up wether signal is sent trough the wire or recived.

                I designed the chassis in a 3d modeling program called "Blender" and printed it on an "Ender 3 Pro" with the 
                help of "Cura" slicer. The chassis is made of two main parts held together by M3 screws.<br>
                The front holds the LCD and the buttons while the back holds the batteries.

                The code for the arduino was written both by Simon and myself, however Simon had more contributions.<br>
                The 1500 lines are divided into 8 different files, have been worked on with 
                the help of version control system "git" and are stored on a "github" page. The repository is however 
                not public. Some of my lines are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The code for detecting button presses</li>
                    <li>The code for showing deciseconds</li>
                    <li>The code for the dice mode</li>
