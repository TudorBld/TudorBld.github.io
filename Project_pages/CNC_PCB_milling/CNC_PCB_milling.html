        <div class="About">
            <p>
                Seeing how long it takes to build a project, I began to look for ways to speed it up. 
                I reaslised I need to split the projects in two parts:<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Design: I need to design all aspects of a project on the computer. It is much easyer to design and 
                simulate on a computer than to build, test and rebuild everything.<br>
            <p>
                2. Production: After the design is ready and tested in simulations, it must be implemented in an 
                automated way, so that it requires as little time as possible and the process is repetable.
            </p>
            <p>
                After researching methods for PCB production I chose milling because it requires no dangereous chemicals 
                and most of the fabrication process is automated. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The end goal of this project is a CNC milling station. Is should:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a high enough precision for milling around DIP and SOIC packages</li>
                <li>Have safety elements implemented (emergency button, electrical safetys, ...)</li>
                <li>Be mobile (should have wheels for easy movement)</li>
                <li>Have space for all tools required in the production of PCB-s</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Compared to other projects that I worked on, this one consists mainly on mechanical 
                design and phisically building 
                the CNC. So, this chapter of the description is the longest.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Design
            </h3>
            <p>
                I began working on the CNC in the spirit of the idea presented above: first design and then build.
                For mechanical design I used a student OnShape account.<br>
                Designing the station took a rather long time, about 4 months. But, after these 4 months I was ready to build, 
                and the digital model of the station allowed me to measure any distance on any part. Building was much
                easier this way.
            </p>
            <img class = "mechanical_pic" id="3d_model" src="3d_model.png">
            <img class = "mechanical_pic" id="Measurement" src="Measurement.png">
            <p>
                One of the biggest chalanges I encountered while designing this station was finding parts and components 
                that both fit together and are available commercially (and don't break the bank). The final shopping list 
                was very long, and I had to both order and phisically buy parts from at least 5 speciality shops.
            </p>
            <p>
                The chassis is made of alluminum profiles for strength and ease of assembly.<br>
                Because milling PCB-s does not put a lot of stress on the milling head, I opted to use pairs of guiding 
                rods as opposed to linear guides, because the rods are cheaper.
            </p>
            <p>
                The more complex parts are made of wood because wood is easier to machine and I don't really have tools for 
                working in metal. The only metal parts that I made myself are the mounts for the stepper motors, 
                because the way I attached the motors is not standard and I had to make my own mounts.

                Production and Assembly
            </h3>
            <p>
                At the time of building this machine I was (and still am) part of the "Bright Students" program at Bosch Cluj 
                Plant. So I had time to build this machine only on saturdays. With 1 day a week, building the station lasted 
                the whole summer.<br>
                But with each passing week the machine was closer to being ready.
            </p>
            <p>
                Measuring, drawing, cuting, drilling, screwing, unscrewing, adjusting and fixing, slowly but surley each 
                pice was ready and assembled.
            </p>

            <img class = "mechanical_pic" id="Almost_all_axes_done" src="Almost_all_axes_done.jpg">
            <p>
                After a long summer and a lot of work, the CNC was assembled.<br>
                Mechanically, the CNC was ready, but the controll circuitry was not. Also, the CNC was not yet a CNC station. 
                So, before talking about the controll circuitry, I'l talk a bit about the bench that I built for the CNC.
            </p>
            <p>
                While working at Bosch Cluj Plant I saw just how convinient it is for each tool to have it's place, 
                and for each table or larger station to have wheels for  easy transportation. That is why I wanted 
                to build a CNC station, not just a CNC. And is also the reason my station has wheels.

                The electric part of the project can be divided in 2: power and control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking on the control side, 
                the most common solution found on the internet is using an arduino with a CNC control shield. However, I
                recently replaced the old motherboard of my Ender3 3D printer and while replacing it I noticed that it uses an 
                AtMega microcontroller. So, I wanted to use the old motherboard instead.<br>
                After figuring out how to burn a bootloader on the board, I tracked every digital IO pin on the board 
                to figure out what it is connected to and uploaded a version of <a href="https://github.com/Paciente8159/uCNC">Î¼CNC</a>
                to the microcontroller.<br>
                It took a little bit of figuring out what everything does, but in the 
                end it worked.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the power side, main power is supplied by a 24V 3Amp rail mounted power supply. The power supply 
                is mounted inside an electrical box, alogside the differential fuse, the ovecurrent fuse and a power switch.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to have a profesional look and a safe design. That is why all electrical and electronic components 
                are mounted inside boxes, the power circuit is fuse protected and placed inside an electrical box with 
                locker.

        <div class="About">
            <p>
                This project required more time than any other personal project I worked on before. It was difficult from 
                many points of view: 3d design, electronic reverse-engineering, building. The hardest part was by far 
                the design process. That is because of the high number of 
                problems that required solutions, because of the limited number of solutions I am capable of actually 
                implementing and because of the limited number of solutions I can buy (either because of lack of stock or 
                because of high prices).
