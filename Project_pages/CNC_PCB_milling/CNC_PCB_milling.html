            <p>
                Seeing how long it takes to build a project, I began to look for ways to shorten that time. 
                I reaslised I need to split the projects in two parts:<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Design: I need to design all aspects of a project on a computer. That is because of the physical limitations 
                that time and space impose on me. By achieving this I can use but one tool for any aspect of a project.<br>
            <p>
                2. Production: After the design is ready and tested via simulations, it must be implemented in an 
                automated way, so that it requires as little time as possible and can be repetable.
            </p>
            <p>
                After researching methods for PCB production I chose milling because it requires no dangereous chemicals 
                and most of the production process is automated. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The end goal of this project is a CNC milling station. Is should:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a high enough precision for milling DIP and SOIC packages</li>
                <li>Have safety elements implemented (emergency button, electrical safetys, ...)</li>
                <li>Be mobile (should have wheels for easy movement)</li>
                <li>Have space for all tools required for producing PCB-s</li>
            </ul>

                Compared to other projects that I worked on, this one consists mainly on designing and phisically building 
                the CNC. So, this chapter of the description is the longest.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Design
            </h3>
            <p>
                I began working on the CNC in the spirit of the idea presented above: first design and then build.
                For mechanical design I used OnShape with the student account I have.<br>
                Designing the station took a rather long time, about 4 months. But, after these 4 months I was ready to build 
                and the digital model of the station allowed me to measure any distance on any part. Building was much
                easier this way.

                The chassis is made of alluminum profiles for strength and ease of assembly.<br>
                The more complex parts are made of wood because wood is easier to machine and I don't really have tools for 
                working in metal. The only metal parts that I made myself are the mounts for the stepper motors, 
                because the mounting type I used is not standard and I had to make my own mounts.

                I designed the chassis in a 3d modeling program called "Blender" and printed it on an "Ender 3 Pro" with the 
                help of "Cura" slicer. The chassis is made of two main parts held together by M3 screws.<br>
                The front holds the LCD and the buttons while the back holds the batteries.

                The code for the arduino was written both by Simon and myself, however Simon had more contributions.<br>
                The 1500 lines are divided into 8 different files, have been worked on with 
                the help of version control system "git" and are stored on a "github" page. The repository is however 
                not public. Some of my lines are:
                <ul>
                    <li>The code for detecting button presses</li>
                    <li>The code for showing deciseconds</li>
                    <li>The code for the dice mode</li>
